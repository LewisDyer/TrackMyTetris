TOTAl STATS:

// Beyond initial account setup, I don't want the user to be able to change total stats. So I want to only include stats which can be derived from
// per-game stats.

// NOTE: these stats apply separately per mode - don't use the "All" figure, especially if you have the Big Block DLC!
