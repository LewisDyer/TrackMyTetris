# TrackMyTetris

## An analytics system for Tetris 99

---

Tetris 99 is a 'battle royale' variation on the classic Tetris game, where 99 players battle it out to be the last one standing. I'm really enjoying the game, and wanted a way to more easily track my progress in the game, and see how my performance changes and (hopefully) improves over time. 

There's a few things I'd especially like to focus on with this system:

* Tetris 99 games are *hectic*, especially on Invictus mode. There's a lot going on, and it's difficult to track information. So all the information the system needs should be provided on the end screen once the player has either won, or been eliminated from the game.
* Tracking should be convenient and straightforward. It should be something that feels natural and intuitive, and doesn't take excessive amounts of time between games. Ideally, tracking a game should take around a minute.
* The system should be able to summarise a player's overall skill in Tetris 99, in a way that they can easily share and show off.
* On the software engineering side, the system should be designed so that I can add new statistics and visualisations with little difficulty.
* The system should also easily show the performance of a player over time, in a way that allows them to consider the strengths and weaknesses of their game. As a potential future addition, the system could even make these recommendations automatically.
